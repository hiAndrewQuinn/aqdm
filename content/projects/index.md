This page is meant to serve as a dumping ground for the various projects I've gotten up to over the years. I do plan to list the most immediately-interesting stuff first; it gets gradually less interesting as you go down the page.

# Most recent work

Recently I've been doing most of my public-facing work on GitHub. I'm a fairly fresh new graduate, and never put much thought into working on actually-useful-to-others things until I finished up my degree. My [most starred repositories](https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=stargazers) unsurprisingly happen to be my most recent.

- [`how-to-host-one-html.page`](https://how-to-host-one-html.page/), an extremely hand-holdy readalong guide for people who have never put an HTML page on the Internet before and want to.
- [`resorter`](https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/resorter), a way to make [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Resorter#source-code)'s implementation of a Bradley-Terry pairwise ranking CLI application easier to install. Or, in plain English, a program which lets you do this:

- [`finfreq`](https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/finfreq), an increasingly machine-generated Anki deck of the top 1000 most-used Finnish words from a frequency list. I've cross posted this to [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnFinnish/comments/vp2848/finfreq_v30_a_top_1000_finnish_words_anki_deck/) a few times while it was under construction, and am now hard at work retooling those same scripts and databases for a much larger deck. I'll post a GIF of what the current deck looks like once I find an Ubuntu replacement for [BahraniApps's excellent GIFCam](https://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/) - the one on the page is quite outdated by now.
- [`vot5`], a semi-readable rotation cypher meant to get over the primary hurdle of rot-13 in that you don't actually need to open a new tab to read it. Yua jast niid tu fucas fur e mumint tu fogari uat whet's biong seod. I used to run a Javascript implementation at `vot5.live`, but I decided to stop paying the cost for it and just throw it into a [Netlify page of its own](https://resonant-fox-74978b.netlify.app/).
  {{< resize-image src="vot5-dot-live.png" alt="vot5.live in action." caption="RUT-13 wes urogonelly divilupid fur piupli tryong tu hodi spuolirs, biceasi piupli dodn't loki eatumetocelly riedong wurds thiy eccodintelly sew.

# Projects I wish got more love

- I really like my [one-image Python `logging` and `colorlog` tutorial](https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/Python-Logging-and-Colorlog-Tutorial), but nobody else seems to care about it. :sad:
