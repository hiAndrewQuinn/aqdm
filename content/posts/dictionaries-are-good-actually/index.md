I've been learning Finnish for a little over a year now, and one of my favorite language-learning gamified interfaces is [Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/). Among many other tiny bits of brilliance, because of this:

{{< resize-image src="vain-hieman.gif" alt="Wiktionary lookup in Clozemaster." caption="Wiktionary lookup in Clozemaster." >}}


In a tiny subwindow, Clozemaster links out to the Wiktionary page for _every single word_ in the sentence you're being asked for in question.

After you learn the basics of a new language, the primary challenge becomes vocabulary acquisition. Looking up a word in the dictionary isn't nearly enough — Dr. Paul Nation estimates that you need _at least_ 7 to 8 high quality meetings with the word in varied contexts in order for the word to really "click":

<div style="
    float: none;
    clear: both;
    width: 100%;
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%;
    padding-top: 25px;
    height: 0;" id="videowrapper">
  <iframe style="
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FlJj8vpJxfE?start=70"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

You might hear that and think to yourself "Ah, so the dictionary isn't really all that helpful after all", because that's a lot of times to see the same word either way. Not so — if you go on to [1:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlJj8vpJxfE&t=145s), you'll notice Dr. Nation actually thinks of learning words as a kind of _conditional_ flow, from `Noticing` to `Retrieval` to `Varied Meetings` to `Elaboration`.

He even says outright:

>**We can't do retrieval** unless we've already **met a word before** and had **some link with its meaning** \[aka, do Noticing\]. ([2:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlJj8vpJxfE&t=210s))

In other words¸ it's not surprising that you can watch hundreds of hours of anime or K-drama and walk away with a single-digit number of Japanese/Korean phrases actually grokked, because *you never linked any of the words with their meanings in the first place*.

As for how one should properly 'do' noticing, Dr. Nation recommends the following simple loop:

1. **Recognize** that the word you're meeting now is one you haven't met before.
2. **Guess from context** what it might mean.
3. **Look it up after** in the dictionary to see whether your guess was correct.

In the past, step 3 took an order of magnitude more time than it does today, which is why guessing from context was such a useful skill to consciously train:

| Word retrieval                                                          | time elapsed (zeroth order)                                                             | Parallelizable?     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Recognizing a word you already know                                     | Tenths of a second                                                                      | Very!               |
| Guessing what a word might mean from prefix, suffix, and root knowledge | A few seconds                                                                           | Slightly            |
| Looking a word up with a mouseclick                                     | A second or two                                                                         | No                  |
| Looking a word up with a well-loved paper dictionary                    | Tens of seconds                                                                         | No                  |
| Looking a word up with a new paper dictionary                           | A minute or two                                                                         | No                  |
| Getting a new paper dictionary                                          | 1 hour - 1 month, depending on historical era | Yes, but irrelevant |

I suspect this might be part of the reason there was such a strong emphasis on traditional grammar studies back in the days people studied Latin and Greek: The faster you get to the point where you can start to mentally break down prefixes, suffixes and word roots, the faster[^1] you get to the point where you can start to guess what a word means from context.

But even if you're a fan of guessing what new words mean (and I am!) it _still_ makes sense to look them up if they're new to you, _just to make sure._ There's just no good reason to skip the mouseclick that it takes on a site like Clozemaster, or, for websites in general, the mouseclick it takes using a plugin like [Readlang](https://readlang.com/). You don't earn special points for doing things the hard way!

[^1]:  Of course, at *that* point you have to start worrying about not using [dream logic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealDreamsAreWeirder) to link the concepts together. I imagine old medieval scholars got a lot of enjoyment out of reverse-engineering the subtle threads of conceptual webbing that were _actually_ used to make the complicated words of Latin and Greek make sense, in a similar way to how Borges's [Pierre Menard](http://raley.english.ucsb.edu/wp-content/Engl10/Pierre-Menard.pdf) didn't just want to _translate_ Don Quixote, he wanted to become the very particular kind of guy who, in 20th-century France, would _spontaneously generate_ the exact text of Don Quixote. Kind of like how they Matrix download skills in [_Everything Everywhere All At Once_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxN1T1uxQ2g), except instead of downloading a skill he's downloading a really weird aesthetic.
