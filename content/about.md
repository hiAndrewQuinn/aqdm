Hi, I'm Andrew. Welcome to my little slice of the Internet. üè†

Without knowing who you are, or why you're interested in me, I'm afraid I don't know quite what to say here. Best perhaps to start with the basics.

- I'm 27 years old.
- I graduated from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in December 2020 with a bachelor's in electrical engineering and a minor in mathematics.[^1]
- I currently live in a small apartment outside the beautiful, frostbitten [biker's paradise](https://www.ouka.fi/oulu/english/cycling1) of [Oulu, Finland](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Oulu):

- I am currently learning Finnish. One of my side projects is [building tools to help others who wish to do the same](https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/finfreq).
- I'm a dual US/EU citizen.
- I'm open for work. My current rate for **remote** freelance work is a flat $100 per day.[^2]


[^1]: Favorite classes: [Dr. Freeman's](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/freeman-randy.html) sequence of linear, discrete, and nonlinear control theory classes. I'll sadly probably never get the chance to use such beautiful math in my professional life again, since software eats the world. But control theory is a true gem of dynamical systems and everyone in engineering should take at least once course in it.
